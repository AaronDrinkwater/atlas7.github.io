    I volunteered to build an official home page for Friends of Russia Dock Woodland - a group of residents
    in Rotherhithe who help to protect and improve our local woodland and Stave Hill ecological park. I worked with
    Clare (my partner who is also part of the group) and put together a usable website in 2 days - built with Jekyll,
    GitHub Pages, and lots of Google searches. I also taught Clare Git, Github, and Markdown so we could work on this
    in parallel - Clare on contents while me on the overall tech stack.
